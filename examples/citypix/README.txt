The solution requirements are as follows:

1. Accept user input and change the background picture to match.  For example, if your user inputs "NYC," they should see a the picture of NYC. Take into consideration that a user might input NYC OR New York City as the input and your JS code should be able to evaluate multiple conditions which account for these variations.  

HINT: if statements should include an OR comprison operator.

2. Do one of these for each city in the images folder.
3. Your code should place all JQuery\JS code in an index.js file

NOTE: You will be responsible for adding link tags for JQuery and the index.js file.

BONUS - create a dropdown menu with the name of each city.  When the user clicks a given city, change the background to match.
