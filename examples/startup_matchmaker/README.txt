GA FEWD-79 Week 03 HW Part 1: Advanced Layout

You'll build a two-page website with links between the two pages.
	The two pages will be index.html and designer.html

We'll build a template file in class that includes a header and a footer.  Use this template to create the two pages in your site. 

Model images
	index_dot_html_model.png is the model for the finished index.html.

	index_dot_html_model.png is the model for the finished designers.html.

Use images/coworking.jpg to for the main image in index.html

NOTE:

Our models have six links at the top.  Focus on "Startup Matchmaker," which will link to index.html and the "DESIGNERS" button, which will link to designers.html.  

Don't worry about the other navigation buttons or the buttons on either page for now.  You can link these to:

<a href="#">[YOUR CONTENT]</a>.  

This is a "dummy link" - developers commonly do this to create a link (for styling purposes) without having it link anywhere (until we know where we want to link to).

ANOTHER NOTE:

Look these CSS properties up on w3schools.com:
opacity, border-radius, box-shadow, and text-decoration
to complete the project. 

BONUS:

Make startup matchmaker responsive!  Remember to draw new wireframes for the mobile view.
